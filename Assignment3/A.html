          JavaScript’s rising popularity has brought with it a lot of changes,
          and the face of web development today is dramatically different. The
          things that we can do on the web nowadays with JavaScript running on
          the server, as well as in the browser, were hard to imagine just
          several years ago, or were encapsulated within sandboxed environments
          like Flash or Java Applets.

          <blockquote>About Node.js</blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>
          Before digging into Node.js solutions, you might want to read up on
          the benefits of using JavaScript across the stack which unifies the
          language and data format (JSON), allowing you to optimally reuse
          developer resources. As this is more a benefit of JavaScript than
          Node.js specifically, we won’t discuss it much here. But it’s a key
          advantage to incorporating Node in your stack.
          <img src="./assets/nodejs.png" class="articleImg" alt="img" />
          As Wikipedia states: “Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8
          JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core
          library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript.”

          <blockquote>The purpose</blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>
          Beyond that, it’s worth noting that Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js,
          was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability,
          “inspired by applications like Gmail”. In Node.js, he gave developers
          a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm. In
          one sentence: Node.js shines in real-time web applications employing
          push technology over websockets. What is so revolutionary about that?
          Well, after over 20 years of stateless-web based on the stateless
          request-response paradigm, we finally have web applications with
          real-time, two-way connections, where both the client and server can
          initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely. This is
          in stark contrast to the typical web response paradigm, where the
          client always initiates communication. Additionally, it’s all based on
          the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS) running over the standard port
          80.
